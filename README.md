# NLP-on-Financial-Statements

### Overview:
In this project, i performed NLP Analysis on 10-k financial statements to generate an alpha factor. For the dataset, I used the end of day from Quotemedia and Loughran-McDonald sentiment word lists.

A 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly-traded company about its financial performance and is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The report contains much more detail than a company's annual report, which is sent to its shareholders before an annual meeting to elect company directors.

Some of the information a company is required to document in the 10-K includes its history, organizational structure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and any other relevant data.
